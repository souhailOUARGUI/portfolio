### Data Sources
The mindmap automatically pulls data from:
- `personalInfo` object (contact details, social links)
- `projects` array (featured projects only)
- `skills` array (advanced proficiency skills only)

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
To add new categories to the mindmap, edit the `createMindmapData` function in `ProfessionalMindmap.tsx`:

```typescript
const categories: Omit<MindmapNode, 'x' | 'y'>[] = [
  // ... existing categories
  {
    id: 'new-category',
    label: 'New Category',
    type: 'category',
    icon: <YourIcon />,
    color: '#YOUR_COLOR',
    children: [
      // ... child nodes
    ]
  }
];
```

### Updating Colors
Each node has a customizable color. Update the `color` property in the node definition to change the appearance.

### Modifying Layout
The mindmap uses a circular layout with categories positioned around the center. Adjust the `radius` and angle calculations in `createMindmapData` to modify the layout.
